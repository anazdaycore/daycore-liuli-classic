// 汀 answers "what now" with ONE thing. 纸屿 answers it with a POSITION in a
// stream. 长卷 answers it with a COORDINATE on a map of today. All three ask
// the same question about the same day — and all three hard-code that day:
// `const date = api.todayIso()` appears verbatim in ting/store.ts,
// zhiyu/store.ts and liuli/store.ts, and none of them ever asks for another.
//
// 页面制 does not offer a fourth answer to "what now". It offers a second AXIS:
// the week strip, the month grid, "jump to a date", "back to today", the
// planning range — every one of those is the same idea wearing different
// clothes, and not one of the other three has anywhere to put it. That is what
// this module is, and it is why none of it belongs in @daycore/core.
//
// ⚠️ It looks like it could be shared with 纸屿, and it cannot. See groupDay.
